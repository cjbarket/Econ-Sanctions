## Setup
* Clone the repository by clicking on the code button and copying the SSH link.
* 
* When installing/importing the Python packages, RStudio will likely ask you to install a miniconda environment--go ahead and install it, as it'll enable you to run the code smoothly from here on out.

## Running the Program
* The cleaning functions for Comtrade and IMF (clean_comtrade and clean_imf, respectively) will not work if you've already cleaned the files that you're passing into these functions.
* You must update the file names when cleaning new Comtrade and IMF data. When you run the Python modules to get new data, the new file names will be printed in the console. These are the file names you should replace each file name with (minus the .csv extension--the cleaning functions will take care of that). Though not mandatory, it'd likely be beneficial to also update the names of the data frames whenever you run new queries.
